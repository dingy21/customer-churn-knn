# Customer Churn Prediction Project
Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, occurs when customers stop doing business with a company or stop using a companyâ€™s services. In this project, two KNN machine learning models(different values of K) were built to identify likely churners, so that the company can incentivize the churners to stay with the company.
